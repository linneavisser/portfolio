                    <h5>Assignment 03.01.01 - Data collection</h5>
                    <p>Use various research methods to collect data in regards to the main theme of basic UX, a t-shirt
                        web shop, and to analyse and present the findings.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>I conducted primary and secondary by using the four research methods I was introduced to - desk, observation, interview and survey
                        research. I collected data regarding t-shirt production, people wearing t-shirts in public, an
                        interview about a generic t-shirt shop as well as a survey done with my fellow classmates mainly
                        regarding t-shirt shopping behaviours.</p>
                    <p>I analysed the findings of the data collected and used some of these for the main assignment in
                        this theme. The research I used was my desk research regarding the environmental impact of t-shirt production
                        and findings from the survey where the majority of participants answered that they care about
                        their environmental footprint when shopping for t-shirts.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 03.02.01 - Early prototypes</h5>
                    <p>Develop our group’s initial ideas into a simple prototype designed with UX and UI conventions in
                        mind.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>By using the four research methods I was introduced to - desk, observation, interview and survey
                        research. I collected data regarding t-shirt production, people wearing t-shirts in public, an
                        interview about a generic t-shirt shop as well as a survey done with my fellow classmates mainly
                        regarding t-shirt shopping behaviours.</p>
                    <p>I analysed the findings of the data collected and used some of these for the main assignment in
                        this theme, including my desk research regarding the environmental impact of t-shirt production
                        and findings from the survey where the majority of participants answered that they care about
                        their environmental footprint when shopping for t-shirts.</p>
                    <p>After deciding on which UX-problems to focus on we created a storyboard to develop a greater
                        understanding of how our solution would solve these problems. Later we used card sorting to
                        design the information architecture of our prototype and think-aloud tests on both our paper
                        prototype and Xd prototype to see where our solution and user interface was succeeding and
                        failing. The findings were then incorporated in the future iterations of our Xd prototype.</p>
                    <h5>My Role</h5>
                    <p>I was responsible for creating the style tile and designed the home page, about page, sizing page
                        and half of the artists pages in our prototype. This included writing the copy for each of these
                        pages, finding and editing relevant pictures. I conducted desk research regarding the pricing of
                        producing the sort of t-shirts we proposed by comparing three similar companies with full price
                        transparency and made the infographic regarding pricing used in the about page.</p>
                    <p>I implemented design principles when designing the Xd and infographic, focusing on adding
                        contrast between colours and sizing in text as well as using gestalt laws. I also focused on the
                        signal to noise ratio by making sure the information I added was relevant for the user.</p>
                    <p>I designed the illustrations for six of the twelve t-shirts in Illustrator and edited them onto
                        the t-shirts in Photoshop.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 03.03.01 - Solution</h5>
                    <p>To create a high-fidelity Xd prototype solving the UX-problems we chose to focus on.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>For the final iteration of our prototype we implemented the findings from our user testing; this
                        included making the buttons bigger for easier accessibility, changing the images on the landing
                        shopping page as the user was unsure if it was on the right page since we had pictures of the
                        “artists” works and not t-shirts, adding more payment options to our checkout flow as well as
                        adding back buttons to all pages for a better user experience.</p>
                    <p>We continued further developing the design of our webshop by changing some of the images,
                        simplifying the layout and adding a Trustpilot logo to our home page to add credibility.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 04.01.01 - A website with a game</h5>
                    <p>Create a responsive website with an animated game using HTML, CSS and JavaScrip.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>The pitch for my game was to keep a baby sloth asleep by collecting moons and sheep.</p>
                    <p>After working on the design I started the coding of the game. I started by learning to use
                        animations and keyframes in CSS. These animations I then added to my Sprites in JavaScript. I
                        used conditional statements in my JavaScript to be able to start, pause, mute etc the game, in
                        which I called on different functions depending on if a condition is true or false.</p>
                    <p>I used the SMD I made as a blueprint for when coding my JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>I recorded one of the sounds for the game myself which I manipulated and
                        amplified in Adobe Audition. For the rest of my sounds and background music I used
                        royalty free music that I also edited in Audition.</p>
                    <p>In the last iteration of the game I made a few changes to design. After playing the games in
                        class
                        I noticed that very few read through long instructions so I shortened them and made it more
                        obvious which were the good and bad elements by adding pictures to my instructions. I rounded
                        the corners of the game screen and instruction screen as well as changde to close button to a
                        back button that matched my other UI-elements for a more cohesive design.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 04.01.02 - Paper prototype</h5>
                    <p>Create a video showing my paper prototype explaning the idea for my game.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>Through the combining of different words exercise in class I came up with my idea based on a poem
                        I liked as a kid.</p>
                    <p>I created my paper prototype to test if the idea would work and ended up feeling unsure if it
                        might
                        be a bit too advanced given the time frame as I would have the main character moving around the
                        game
                        screen depending on if you gain/lose points.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 04.01.04 - Activity diagram</h5>
                    <p>Creating an activity diagram that describes what happens when you play the game start to finish.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>I did my activity diagram based on the idea I was unsure of to decide whether it would be
                        feasible or not.</p>
                    <p>I used the program provided by the teachers. When doing the activity diagram I went through the
                        idea of my game step by step visualising the order of events that would occur whilst playing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>After doing the activity diagram and seeing the progression of actions and how the events would
                        interact with each other I decided to simplify my idea.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 04.02.01 - Asset list and design documentation</h5>
                    <p>Create a cohesive design for the game based on general game design rules, document the progress
                        and create a website with all the visual assets.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>I created a moodboard with different minimalistic illustrations I was inspired by for the design
                        of my game. I was mainly inspired by Quentin Monge and Tove Janssons drawings, one of which I
                        used to extract my colour palette from. I added different shades of green to add to the feel of
                        the rainforest.</p>
                    <p>When designing my main character I used circles that I manipulated in different ways to add
                        dimension to the character. To make the user emphasise with my main character more I applied the
                        baby bias when designing it, making its face and eyes unproportionally big for its body.</p>
                    <p>I kept the bouba/kiki effect in mind when designing both the character and the good and bad
                        elements, making sure that all my good elements were rounded and the bad ones sharp and edgy.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the background design I used darker colours in the foreground and lighter colours the further
                        away an item is to add dimension.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 02.01.01 - Russian Constructivism</h5>
                    <p>Create a mobile view website about Russian Constructivism using basic HTML and CSS.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>The focus of the first theme was working with different design principles including visual
                        contrast, colour theory and Gestalt laws as well as being introduced to html and css.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was provided with all the content to edit myself using semantic markup for the text and
                        compressing
                        and changing image format for the images.</p>
                    <p>I worked in Photoshop when editing and compressing the images where I used png for
                        photographs as the
                        compression is lossless and gif for illustrations as it is a much smaller file size and it
                        can
                        handle solid colours well.</p>
                    <p>I created an Xd prototype incorporating the design laws I had been introduced to. A few of
                        the
                        Gestalt laws I used when
                        designing my Xd prototype and website were the figure-ground phenomenon, law of closure, law
                        of
                        similarity, law of proximity, law of common region and law of continuity.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="right">
                    <h5>Assignment 02.03.01 - Interest-based Website</h5>
                    <p>Create a responsive website based on one of the following design styles - organic, pop art or
                        minimalism, as well as create content for the site based on an interest of our own choosing.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>I chose minimalism and started by doing research about it and minimalistic web design followed by
                        creating a moodboard with
                        a few of the key elements I found as well as my chosen interest, the singularity. From there I
                        created a style tile specifying colours, typography and the icons for my
                        site.</p>
                    <p>I created a low-fidelity paper wireframe and then an Xd prototype where I incorporated the design
                        principles I had been working with before. During this assignment I also worked with
                        composition,
                        layout and grid, both in CSS and when
                        designing.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was introduced to different multi-device layout patterns of which I decided to use the mostly
                        fluid
                        pattern, starting with two columns in desktop view with a glide symmetrical pattern that turns
                        into
                        a single column for smaller devices. I chose this pattern as it worked well with the desktop
                        layout with large margins and scalable images.
                    </p>
                    <p>A part of my site was dedicated to the influence in popular media where I used images licensed
                        under
                        a few different creative commons licenses so a part of my process was learning about how to
                        attribute images according to their license.</p>

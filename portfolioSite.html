                    <h5>Assignment 06 - The portfolio site</h5>
                    <p>Create a portfolio site showcasing my 1st semester projects and what I have learnt.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>I started by gathering lots of inspiration from pinterest, awwward and behance which I
                        curated in a moodboard. I created a low-fidelity wireframe and after an Xd prototype.
                        I wanted to keep my design minimal and utilize the white space to the advantage of my design by
                        having a high signal-to-noise ratio.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Design</h5>
                    <p>I developed the design with an emphasis on contrast by using strong colour contrast between the
                        background and text and a lot of contrast in font size and weight to establish a hierarchy
                        on my portfolio site.</p>
                    <p>I chose to adopt a few well-established design conventions to enhance the user experience, like
                        having the navigation bar in the top right corner, using a burger menu in narrow viewports and
                        having the logo redirect to the home page.</p>
                </section>
                <figure class="figR1"><img src="Images/moodboard-portfolio.png"
                        alt="Moodboard for my portfolio website">
                    <figcaption>Moodboard for my portfolio site.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <section class="right">
                    <h5>Typography</h5>
                    <p>I wanted to create typographic contrast by using two different forms of typefaces. The typefaces
                        I chose is Epilogue for h1, h2 and h3 elements which is a simple sans serif one with a heavy
                        weight and Freight Neo, a humanist sans-serif typeface in a lighter weight. I thought these two
                        created an elegant contrast when used in my website, each highlighting different elements on my
                        portfolio page.</p>
                    <p>A large part of the inspiration I gathered was about kinetic typography. I started
                        experimenting with creating simple variations in After Effects but decided to code a wavy
                        animation using CSS. By adding an animation-delay to each of the spans child
                        elements I achieved a staggered effect to it.</p>
                        <h5>Composition and layout</h5>
                        <p>When designing the Xd prototype and portfolio site I focused on the rule of thirds in regards to
                            the layout. In my Xd prototype I could calculate exactly where to place each element for it to
                            land on each third and thus create a very appealing layout, however I found it a bit harder
                            executing that level of precision when coding the actual site.</p>
                        <p>In regards to my responsive design I adapted the Column Drop layout, my layout starts with
                            multiple columns that ends up in a vertical column for smaller screens.
                        </p>

                <section class="third">
                    <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
                    <p>I did a 5 second test on my first landing page to understand what the users first impression of
                        my portfolio site was in regards to the design and what it was about. I received very positive
                        feedback regarding the design but very few understood what the site was about. I therefore
                        redesigned my landing page by adding more information, after which I did another 5 second test
                        with other users. This time the majority of users understood that it was a portfolio or project
                        site.</p>
                    <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                    <p>I used Javascript to activate my burger menu for mobile view and for my up and down arrow on two
                        pages. To get my script to work for both pages I added a function with a condition, depending on which
                        page you are on different functions and eventListeners work.</p>

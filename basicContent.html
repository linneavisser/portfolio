                    <h5>Assignment 05.01.01 - A story without words</h5>
                    <p>Create a 60 second video telling a story from start to finish without words.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>I did this project with a classmate. We spend a lot of time exploring different ideas through
                        brainstorming. We used S.C.R.A.P as one our focal points during our ideation process,
                        making sure we could answer all of the questions for each idea we came up with. We decided to
                        keep it rather simple by telling a story around a recipe - but not by just filming the cooking
                        process, but instead show snippets throughout the process from finding a recipe to serving it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Of the five shots we focused on the closeup of hands and alternative shots to keep the viewer
                        interested and engaged for the 60 seconds.
                        We used diegetic sound, like the sound of flipping through a book and putting down a plate as
                        well as a non diegetic sound background song throughout.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the editing process we realised we had a lot of material, including a lot of b-roll but
                        since the video was only 60 seconds the majority of shots were needed for the progression of the
                        story so we could only use a small amount of it. We derived some of the diegetic sounds we used
                        from the b-roll.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 05.02.02 - Pre-production part 1: Treatment</h5>
                    <p>Write a treatment containing the title, theme, logline and the treatment/synopsis for our group's
                        video.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>As a part of the main assignment in this theme we were tasked to create a video appealing to
                        pathos for the client, Free Fridge Copenhagen.</p>
                    <p>In this group project we decided to each come up with a minimum of one video suggestion per
                        person that we pitched to each other. As a group we had already conducted a lot of research
                        as well as created relevant personas that we kept in mind whilst each coming up
                        with an idea.</p>
                    <p>After pitching we did an impact analysis of each of the suggestions where we focused on how our
                        personas would react and relate to the proposed video and if we would be able to execute the
                        idea well
                        with the means we had. After pitching we decided to focus on five of our ideas and we each wrote
                        a
                        treatment for one.</p>
                    <h5>My role</h5>
                    <p>I pitched the idea “big pathos” and wrote the treatment for it.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 05.03.01 - Pre-production part 2: Storyboard</h5>
                    <p>To create a storyboard, showing shot by shot all the relevant information needed for our video
                        and for our teachers to approve it.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>We decided to further develop two of our ideas - one for our landing page and one which was to be
                        used for promotional context which we did a storyboard for. The main objective of the video was
                        to
                        attract new volunteers by highlighting the sense of community.
                    </p>
                    <p>We went over the video shot by shot deciding on all details like
                        location, shot, props and camera angles before finalising our storyboard. When creating our
                        storyboard we were mindful of composition and when possible incorporated the rule of thirds.
                    </p>
                    <p>After drawing up the storyboard we went over the dramaturgical curve together, pinpointing the
                        different stages of our video in accordance to the curve.</p>

                    <h5>Assignment 05.03.02 - Customer pitch</h5>
                    <p>Give a Pecha Kucha style presentation to the client presenting our solution to the brief given,
                        including the video, website and any other relevant visual design work.</p>
                    <h5>Process</h5>
                    <p>When developing our Pecha Kucha presentation we wanted to emphasize how our solution solved some
                        of the problems the client expressed during the client brief. Each team member focused on one
                        part of the solution in our presentation to the client. Our team chose to focus on
                        attracting new volunteers from the specified target groups as well as private donors.</p>
                    <p>The client
                        mentioned that they had a hard time getting volunteers involved for longer periods of time, our
                        solution to this was to highlight the positives of volunteering in our video by showing
                        volunteers belonging to a strong community.</p>
                    <h5>My role</h5>
                    <p>I presented how the two personas we created would relate to our video as well as the development
                        of the visual design.
                        I primarily worked with redesigning the visual identity as well as creating the logo. I focused
                        on the sense
                        sharing when creating the new logo as the client had mentioned that they eventually would like
                        to expand their organisation into other areas than just food.
